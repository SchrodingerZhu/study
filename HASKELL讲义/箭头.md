# Arrow

## definition
![function](https://www.haskell.org/arrows/arrow.png)
A computation takes inputs of some type and produces outputs of another type.

(Thanks to Cale Gibbard for the improved artwork.)

Hence Hughes defined a Haskell class of binary type constructors:

```haskell
class Category y => Arrow y where
    -- Minimal implementation: arr and first
    arr    :: (a -> b) -> y a b                 -- converts function to arrow
    first  :: y a b -> y (a, c) (b, c)          -- maps over first component

    second :: y a b -> y (c, a) (c, b)          -- maps over second component
    (***)  :: y a c -> y b d -> y (a, b) (c, d) -- first and second combined
    (&&&)  :: y a b -> y a c -> y a (b, c)      -- (***) on a duplicated value

```

with a number of axioms. This and related classes are in the `Control.Arrow` module now distributed with all Haskell implementations. Workers in denotational semantics have independently defined equivalent structures, called Freyd-categories or (more generally) premonoidal notions of computation. 

- image for `arr`:
  ![arr](https://www.haskell.org/arrows/arr.png)
- image for `(>>>)`
  ![(>>>)](https://www.haskell.org/arrows/compose.png)
- image for `first`:
  ![first](https://www.haskell.org/arrows/first.png)

## how to use
Here is an example:
![addA](https://www.haskell.org/arrows/addA.png)
```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE Arrows#-}
addA :: Arrow a => a b Int -> a b Int -> a b Int
addA f g = proc x -> do
    y <- f -< x
    z <- g -< x
    returnA -< y + z
```
Here are two special things:

- `proc` (arrow abstraction)
    is a kind of lambda, except that it constructs an arrow instead of a function. 
- `-<` (arrow application)
    feeds the value of an expression into an arrow. 

Here is another form:
```haskell
addA f g = arr (\ x -> (x, x)) >>>
        first f >>> arr (\ (y, x) -> (x, y)) >>>
        first g >>> arr (\ (z, y) -> y + z)
```

And yes another form:

```haskell
addA f g = f &&& g >>> arr (\ (y, z) -> y + z)
```
