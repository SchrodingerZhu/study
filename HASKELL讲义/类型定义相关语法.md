# 类型定义相关语法

## type 别名
```haskell
type List a = [a]
type IntList = [Int]
```
`type`只是创建别名，并不会创建新类别

## newtype 新类别
```haskell
newtype Inch = Inch Double deriving Eq
newtype State s a = State {
    runState :: s -> (s, a)
}
```

`newtype`相比`data`少了类型标签，效率更高

## Bottom
在Prelude中`undefined`代表底类型，即无法计算的值(`_|_`)

## Uboxed
```haskell
Int#
Array#
```
这种`#`表示没有被打包的类型。常用于底层操作。很多相应的类型定义在`GHC.Exts`和`GHC.Prim`中

### UnboxedTuples
编译器选项`UnboxedTuples`引入`UnboxedTuples`，语法如下：
```haskell
(# e_1, ..., e_n #)
```

### UnboxedSums
编译器选项`UnboxedSums`引入非打包带`Sum Type`，语法如下：
```haskell
(# t_1 | t_2 | ... | t_N #)
```

### MagicHash
编译器选项`MagicHash`可以放开`#`语法的限制，在操作`Unboxed`类型是需要开启。

## Data.Coerce
`newtype`定义的类型有时可以理解为和底层类型是等价的，`Coercible`则提供了这样的类型互转的功能。

```haskell
class Coercible a b
```

这个定义就是描述了`a`, `b`底层相同

```haskell
coerce :: Coercible * a b => a -> b
```

这个函数则是用来转换类型的。

需要注意的`Coerce`的示例是自动识别的，不需要手动添加，也不允许手动添加。

系统推导时会有这样一个定义
```haskell
instance Coercible a a
instance Coercible a T => Coercible a NT
instance Coercible T b => Coercible NT b

instance Coercible b b' => Coercible (D a b c) (D a b' c')
```
前三个规则都很好理解，最后一个其实描述了类型地位的概念，`Haskell`类型分为：
- nominal 主类型
- representational 表象类型
- phantom 幻影类型

这三个类型和`abc`分别对应，推导规则是：
- 主类型相同
- 表象类型`Coercible`
- 幻影类型任意

手动更改类型地位：
```haskell
data Set a = ...
type role Set nominal
```

其他库中常用运算符：
```haskell
(#.) :: Coercible b c => (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
(#.) f = coerce
```


## Multi-parameter type class
Basically, type classes which can take multiple arguments, such as:
```haskell
class Monad m => VarMonad m v where
  new :: a -> m (v a)
  get :: v a -> m a
  put :: v a -> a -> m ()

instance VarMonad IO IORef where ...
instance VarMonad (ST s) (STRef s) where ...

```

To enable them, use the `{-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-}` pragma.

If you think of a single-parameter type class as a set of types, then a multi-parameter type class is a relation between types.

Naive use of MPTCs may result in ambiguity, so functional dependencies were developed as a method of resolving that ambiguity, declaring that some subset of the parameters is sufficient to determine the values of the others.

Some uses of MPTCs with functional dependencies can be replaced with type families.

## Functional dependencies

Suppose you want to implement some code to perform simple linear algebra:

data Vector = Vector Int Int deriving (Eq, Show)
data Matrix = Matrix Vector Vector deriving (Eq, Show)

You want these to behave as much like numbers as possible. So you might start by overloading Haskell's Num class:

```haskell
instance Num Vector where
  Vector a1 b1 + Vector a2 b2 = Vector (a1+a2) (b1+b2)
  Vector a1 b1 - Vector a2 b2 = Vector (a1-a2) (b1-b2)
  {- ... and so on ... -}
```

```haskell
instance Num Matrix where
  Matrix a1 b1 + Matrix a2 b2 = Matrix (a1+a2) (b1+b2)
  Matrix a1 b1 - Matrix a2 b2 = Matrix (a1-a2) (b1-b2)
  {- ... and so on ... -}
```

The problem comes when you want to start multiplying quantities. You really need a multiplication function which overloads to different types:

```haskell
(*) :: Matrix -> Matrix -> Matrix
(*) :: Matrix -> Vector -> Vector
(*) :: Matrix -> Int -> Matrix
(*) :: Int -> Matrix -> Matrix
{- ... and so on ... -}
```
How do we specify a type class which allows all these possibilities?

We could try this:
```haskell
class Mult a b c where
  (*) :: a -> b -> c

instance Mult Matrix Matrix Matrix where
  {- ... -}

instance Mult Matrix Vector Vector where
  {- ... -}
```
That, however, isn't really what we want. As it stands, even a simple expression like this has an ambiguous type unless you supply an additional type declaration on the intermediate expression:
```haskell
m1, m2, m3 :: Matrix
(m1 * m2) * m3              -- type error; type of (m1*m2) is ambiguous
(m1 * m2) :: Matrix * m3    -- this is ok
```
After all, nothing is stopping someone from coming along later and adding another instance:
```haskell
instance Mult Matrix Matrix (Maybe Char) where
  {- whatever -}
```
The problem is that c shouldn't really be a free type variable. When you know the types of the things that you're multiplying, the result type should be determined from that information alone.

You can express this by specifying a functional dependency, or fundep for short:
```haskell
class Mult a b c | a b -> c where
  (*) :: a -> b -> c
```
This tells Haskell that c is uniquely determined from a and b.

Fundeps have lots more uses than just implementing C++-style function overloading, of course. See the paper by Mark P. Jones for further details.

Fundeps are not standard Haskell 98. (Nor are multi-parameter type classes, for that matter.) They are, however, supported at least in GHC and Hugs and will almost certainly end up in Haskell'. 

The following example makes use of the FlexibleInstances, MultiParamTypeClasses and FunctionalDependencies GHC extensions.

```haskell
-- Read as: "container" type determines "elem" type.
class Extract container elem | container -> elem where
  extract :: container -> elem
```
The functional dependency "container -> elem" promises that we won't declare multiple instances with the same "container" type.
```haskell
instance Extract (a,b) a where
  extract (x,_) = x
```
Because of the functional dependency we can't have the previous instance *and* this one:
```haskell
instance Extract (a,b) b where ...
```
Because of the functional dependency we can say:
```haskell
v = extract ('x', 3)

and it will infer the type

v :: Char
```
Without the functional dependency, both instances above would be allowed, and the type of v would be potentially ambiguous. Even if only one instance is defined, the type system will not figure it out without the functional dependency.
